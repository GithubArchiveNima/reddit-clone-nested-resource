# README

Among the commands that I ran:

rake db:create

rails s

rails g controller Topics    

- Don has a lecture on how template vars are passed... I will send it to you in the actual notes

rake g model Topic

rake db:migrate

## TO RUN THIS PROJECT

```
bundle
rake db:setup
rails s

Then just go to localhost:3000
```

`rails c` is so you can run arbitrary ruby commands (Active record stuff, etcru...)
